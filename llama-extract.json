    "Recommendation": "Covers identifying and treating primary hypertension in people aged 18 and over, including those with type 2 diabetes. Provides recommendations for diagnosis, measurement, risk assessment, lifestyle advice, drug treatment, monitoring, and blood pressure targets. If starting or changing diuretic treatment for hypertension, offer a thiazide-like diuretic, such as indapamide, in preference to a conventional thiazide diuretic such as bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide. Recommends stepwise antihypertensive drug treatment with monotherapy as step 1, an individualised approach for steps 2 and 3, confirmation of resistant hypertension before step 4, and referral for same-day specialist review based on emergency symptoms.",

  "Procedure": "Blood pressure measurement (clinic, home, postural), device validation and maintenance, specialist referral for persistent symptoms.",
  "Investigation": "Urine albumin:creatinine ratio, haematuria test, blood sample for HbA1C, electrolytes, creatinine, eGFR, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, fundi examination, 12-lead ECG",
  "Monitoring": "Monitor blood pressure using clinic measurements, ABPM, or HBPM; provide annual review of care; monitor response to lifestyle changes or drug treatment.",
  "Lifestyle": "Lifestyle advice including healthy diet, regular exercise, reduced alcohol intake, reduced caffeine, low sodium intake, smoking cessation, and support for healthy lifestyle change.",
  "Prevention": null,
  "Treatment_Algorithm": "Stepwise antihypertensive treatment algorithm: Step 1 - ACE inhibitor or ARB for adults with type 2 diabetes or under 55 (not Black African/African-Caribbean); CCB for those 55+ or Black African/African-Caribbean without type 2 diabetes; alternatives if not tolerated; do not combine ACE inhibitor and ARB. Step 2 - add CCB or thiazide-like diuretic. Step 3 - triple therapy (combination therapy). Step 4 - confirm resistant hypertension, consider aldosterone antagonist, alpha- or beta-blocker, or seek specialist advice.",
  "Clinical_Decision": "If ACE inhibitor not tolerated, offer ARB. If CCB not tolerated, offer thiazide-like diuretic. Use clinical judgement for frailty or multimorbidity. Refer for specialist assessment if secondary causes suspected. If hypertension is not controlled in adults taking step 1 treatment, add a CCB or thiazide-like diuretic; if not controlled on step 2, offer triple therapy; if not controlled on triple therapy, consider step 4 treatment or specialist advice. Do not start dual therapy at step 1; confirm resistant hypertension before step 4; refer for same-day specialist review if emergency symptoms are present.",
